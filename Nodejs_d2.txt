1)	What is Node.js?
	A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm , is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
	A platform which allows us to run JavaScript on a computer / server.
	Read, delete, and update files.
	Easily communicate with a database.

2)	Why is Node.js so Popular?
	It uses JavaScript
	Very fast (runs on the V8 engine & uses non - blocking code)
	Huge ecosystem of open-source packages (npm)
	Great for real - time services (like chats)

3)	Pre-Requisites for Node.js:
	JavaScript
	HTML
	About the command line

4)	What are JavaScript Engines?
	Computers do not understand JavaScript. A JavaScript engine takes JavaScript and converts it into something it does understand - machine code.
	Node.js is written in C ++
	The heart of Node.js is the V8 engine
	The V8 engine converts our JS into machine code

5)	What is V8?
	V8 is Googleâ€™s open-source high-performance JavaScript and Web Assembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and Web Assembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application.

6)	What are Global Objects?
	Global Objects are the objects that are available in all modules. Global Objects are built-in objects that are part of the JavaScript and can be used directly in the application without importing any module.

7)	What is Function Expression?
	Function Expression allows us to create an anonymous function which doesn't have any function name.
	Syntax for Function Expression (anonymous):
	let variableName = function (x, y) {statements... return (z)};

8)	What is a Module in Node.js?
	A set of functions that we include in our application.
	Built-in Modules:
	Node.js has a set of built-in modules which we can use without any further installation.

9)	How to include Modules?
	To include a module, the require () function is used with the name of the module:
	var http = require('http');

10)	What is module pattern?
	The Module Pattern is one of the important patterns in JavaScript. It is a commonly used Design Pattern which is used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope.
